# High-Dimensional Time Series
We evaluate methods and conduct simulation studies for high-dimensional time series models. (more sophisticated description) 

## Continous integration with Travis CI to ensure Reproducibility
To ensure reproducibility, we have integrated Travis CI. The build's history can be found here [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HumanCapitalAnalysis/microeconometrics-course-project-manuhuth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/manuhuth/hidiTS)
